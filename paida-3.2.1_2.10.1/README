Using with Python :
    + Python2.3 or later >> http://www.python.org/
        ++ If tkinter module is enabled, you can use tkinter GUI engine
            +++ Tix extension etc. do not be needed. Tcl/Tk and X11 only.
            +++ If use with IPython, it's better that both Tcl/Tk and Tkinter are configured with pthread-enabled.
            +++ MacOSX users : Tcl/Tk Aqua 8.4.7 or later is recommended.
        ++ If zlib module is enabled, you can use compressed XML store files.

Using with Jython :
    + Jython2.1 or later >> http://www.jython.org/

 Notes
#######

With Jython2.1, we can not output a zipped XML file because of Jython's limitation. Unzipped XML file is OK.

    Notes:
        + [*1] You may need to be a root user depending on the installation directory.
        + You can move the "paida" folder to your Python's "site-packages" directory.

Using with Jython :
    + Make sure you have working Jython at first.
        If not, get it from http://www.jython.org/ 
        PAIDA works Jython2.1 or later.
    + Download the latest PAIDA package.
        from SourceForge download site 
    + Unpack it in any directory you want.
    + Move into the unpacked folder.
