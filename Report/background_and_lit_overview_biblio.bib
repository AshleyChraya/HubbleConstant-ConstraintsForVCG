   abstract = {We present a test of the statistical method introduced by Bernard F. Shutz in 1986 using only gravitational waves to infer the Hubble constant (H 0) from GW190814, the first high-probability neutron-star-black-hole (NS-BH) merger candidate detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer. We apply a baseline test of this method to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and find H 0 = 70 +35.0 −18.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 (maximum a posteriori and 68.3 highest density posterior interval) for a galaxy B-band luminosity threshold of L B ≥ 0.001 L * B with a correction for catalog incompleteness. Repeating the calculation for GW190814, we obtain H 0 = 67 +41.0 −26.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 and H 0 = 71 +34.0 −30.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 for L B ≥ 0.001 L * B and L B ≥ 0.626 L * B , respectively. Combining the posteriors for both events yields H 0 = 70 +29.0 −18.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 , demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational-wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the L B threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H 0 values.We repeat the joint inference using the low-spin PhenomPNRT (Abbott et al. 2019a) and the newly available combined (SEOBNRv4PHM + IMRPhenomPv3HM; Abbott et al. 2020) posterior samples for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively, achieving a tighter constraint of H 0 = 69 +29.0 −14.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 .},

Equation of state of the model is P = −A(a)/ρ, where A(a) = A 0 a −n is a positive function of the cosmological scale factor a, A 0 and n being constants. The variable Chaplygin gas interpolates from dust-dominated era to quintessence dominated era. The model is found to be compatible with current type Ia Supernovae data and location of first peak if the values of Ω m and n lie in the interval [0.017, 0.117] and [−1.3, 2.6] respectively.},

   abstract = {Observations of the gravitational-wave (GW) event S190425z registered by the LIGO/Virgo detectors with the Anti-Coincidence Shield (ACS) of the gamma-ray spectrometer SPI aboard the INTEGRAL observatory are presented. With a high probability (> 99) it was associated with a neutron star merger in a close binary system. This is only the second event of such type in the history of gravitational-wave observations (after GW 170817). A weak gamma-ray burst, GRB 190425, consisting of two pulses in ∼ 0.5 and ∼ 5.9 s after the moment of merging the stars in S190425z was detected by SPI-ACS. The pulses had a priori reliability of 3.5σ and 4.4 σ as single events and 5.5σ as a combined event. Analysis of the SPI-ACS count rate history recorded these days (∼ 125 ks observations in total) has shown that the rate of the appearance of two close pulses with characteristics of GRB 190425 by chance does not exceed 6.4 × 10 −5 s −1 (that is, by chance such events occur on average every ∼ 4.3 hours). We note that the time profile of the gamma-ray burst GRB 190425 has a lot in common with the profile of the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A accompanying the GW 170817 event; that both the mergers of neutron stars were the closest (∼ < 150 Mpc) of all the events registered by the LIGO/Virgo detectors; and that there were no confident excesses of gamma-ray emission over the background detected in any of ∼ 30 black hole merger events recorded to the moment by these detectors. No hard X-ray flares were detected in the field of view of the SPI and IBIS-ISGRI gamma-ray telescopes aboard INTEGRAL. This, as well as the lack of detection of gamma-ray emission from GRB 190425 by the GBM gamma-ray burst monitor of the Fermi observatory assuming its occultation by the Earth, can significantly reduce the localization area for the source of this gravitational-wave event. The estimates of the parameters Eiso and Ep for the gamma-ray burst GRB 190425 are obtained and compared with the similar parameters for the GRB 170817A burst.},

   abstract = {On 2019 April 25, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a compact binary coalescence with signal-to-noise ratio 12.9. The Virgo detector was also taking data that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90% credible intervals for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 $M_\{\odot\}$ (1.45 to 1.88 $M_\{\odot\}$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual binary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp mass $1.44^\{+0.02\}_\{-0.02\} M_\{\odot\}$ and the total mass $3.4^\{+0.3\}_\{-0.1\}\,M_\{\odot\}$ of this system are significantly larger than those of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one or both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out from gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based on its inconsistency with the known Galactic binary neutron star population. Under the assumption that the signal was produced by a binary neutron star coalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to $250-2810 \text\{Gpc\}^\{-3\}\text\{yr\}^\{-1\}$.},

GRB 170817A is likely to have an internal jet or another origin such as cocoon emission , shock-breakout, or a flare from a viscous disc. In this paper we assume that the γ-ray emission is caused by energy dissipation within a relativistic jet and we model the afterglow synchrotron emission from a reverse-and forward-shock in the outflow. We show the afterglow for a low-luminosity γ-ray burst (GRB) jet with a high Lorentz-factor (Γ); a low-Γ and low-kinetic energy jet; a low-Γ, high kinetic energy jet; structured jets viewed at an inclination within the jet-half-opening angle; and an off-axis 'typical' GRB jet. All jet models will produce observable afterglows on various timescales. The late-time afterglow from 10-110 days can be fit by a Gaus-sian structured jet viewed at a moderate inclination, however the GRB is not directly reproduced by this model. These jet afterglow models can be used for future GW detected NS merger counterparts with a jet afterglow origin.},

   abstract = {We present ACS, NICMOS, and Keck AO-assisted photometry of 20 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the HST Cluster Supernova Survey. The SNe Ia were discovered over the redshift interval 0.623 < z < 1.415. Fourteen of these SNe Ia pass our strict selection cuts and are used in combination with the world's sample of SNe Ia to derive the best current constraints on dark energy. Ten of our new SNe Ia are beyond redshift z = 1, thereby nearly doubling the statistical weight of HST-discovered SNe Ia beyond this redshift. Our detailed analysis corrects for the recently identified correlation between SN Ia luminosity and host galaxy mass and corrects the NICMOS zeropoint at the count rates appropriate for very distant SNe Ia. Adding these supernovae improves the best combined constraint on dark energy density, ρ DE (z), at redshifts 1.0 < z < 1.6 by 18% (including systematic errors). For a flat ΛCDM universe, we find Ω Λ = 0.729 +0.014 −0.014 (68% CL including systematic errors). For a flat wCDM model, we measure a constant dark energy equation-of-state parameter w = −1.013 +0.068 −0.073 (68% CL). Curvature is constrained to ∼ 0.7% in the owCDM model and to ∼ 2% in a model in which dark energy is allowed to vary with parameters w 0 and w a. Tightening further the constraints on the time evolution of dark energy will require several improvements, including high-quality multi-passband photometry of a sample of several dozen z > 1 SNe Ia. We describe how such a sample could be efficiently obtained by targeting cluster fields with WFC3 on HST. The updated supernova Union2.1 compilation of 580 SNe is available at http://supernova.},

   abstract = {Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) light curves have been used to prove the universe is expanding. As standard candles, SNe Ia appear to indicate the rate of expansion has increased in the past and is now decreasing. This independent evaluation of SNe Ia light curves demonstrates a Malmquist Type II bias exists in the body of supernova data. If this bias is properly addressed, there is very little budget for time dilation in the light curves of supernova. A non-relativistic distance modulus is proposed, which is based on the predictable attenuation of light by an intergalactic CREIL (Coherent Raman Effects on Incoherent Light) radiation transfer functions. CREIL intrinsically displace the red shift of quasars and other blue objects relative to the rest of the universe. Evidence of these radiation transfer functions is found in the spectral distribution of quasars, and in the continuum emission and total luminosity functions of the universe in the IR and NIR bandwidths. These radiation transfer functions may also contribute to the Tully-Fisher relationship, and resolve the degeneracy in the microwave power function. The anomalous accelerations of the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes towards the sun may be explained by these mechanisms. Without relativistic expansion, new explanations are required to explain background radiation and light element synthesis. An electro-gravimetric energy transfer function activated at extremely low temperatures in molecular hydrogen by a Bose-Einstein condensation is proposed as a candidate mechanism. This proposed solution to Obler's paradox hints of a tantalizing link between the large numbers theories of Mach and Dirac and a non-Friedman field limited gravimetric tensor. This is a highly speculative reintroduction of Hoyle's steady-state cosmology.},

   abstract = {We analyze the signal processing required for the optimal detection of a stochastic background of gravitational radiation using laser interferometric detectors. Starting with basic assumptions about the statistical properties of a stochastic gravity-wave background, we derive expressions for the optimal filter function and signal-to-noise ratio for the cross-correlation of the outputs of two gravity-wave detectors. Sensitivity levels required for detection are then calculated. Issues related to: (i) calculating the signal-to-noise ratio for arbitrarily large stochastic backgrounds, (ii) performing the data analysis in the presence of nonstationary detector noise, (iii) combining data from multiple detector pairs to increase the sensitivity of a stochastic background search, (iv) correlating the outputs of 4 or more detectors, and (v) allowing for the possibility of correlated noise in the outputs of two detectors are discussed. We briefly describe a computer simulation that was used to "experimentally" verify the theoretical calculations derived in the paper, and which mimics the generation and detection of a simulated stochastic gravity-wave signal in the presence of simulated detector noise. Numerous graphs and tables of numerical data for the five major interferometers (LIGO-WA, LIGO-LA, VIRGO, GEO-600, and TAMA-300) are also given. This information consists of graphs of the noise power spectra, overlap reduction functions, and optimal filter functions; also included are tables of the signal-to-noise ratios and sensitivity levels for cross-correlation measurements between different detector pairs. The treatment given in this paper should be accessible to both theorists involved in data analysis and experimentalists involved in detector design and data acquisition.},

   abstract = {Physics welcomes the idea that space contains energy whose gravitational effect approximates that of Einstein's cosmological constant, ; today the concept is termed dark energy or quintessence. Physics also suggests that dark energy could be dynamical, allowing for the arguably appealing picture of an evolving dark-energy density approaching its natural value, zero, and small now because the expanding universe is old. This would alleviate the classical problem of the curious energy scale of a millielectron volt associated with a constant. Dark energy may have been detected by recent cosmological tests. These tests make a good scientific case for the context, in the relativistic Friedmann-LemaıˆtreLemaıˆtre model, in which the gravitational inverse-square law is applied to the scales of cosmology. We have well-checked evidence that the mean mass density is not much more than one-quarter of the critical Einstein-de Sitter value. The case for detection of dark energy is not yet as convincing but still serious; we await more data, which may be derived from work in progress. Planned observations may detect the evolution of the dark-energy density; a positive result would be a considerable stimulus for attempts at understanding the microphysics of dark energy. This review presents the basic physics and astronomy of the subject, reviews the history of ideas, assesses the state of the observational evidence, and comments on recent developments in the search for a fundamental theory.

set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place
constraints on the Hubble constant (H_0), the mass density (Omega_M), the
cosmological constant (Omega_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q_0), and the
dynamical age of the Universe (t_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia
are, on average, 10% to 15% farther than expected in a low mass density
(Omega_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve
fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor
eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e.,
Omega_Lambda > 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q_0 < 0).
With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega_M > 0, the
spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q_0 <0 at the 2.8 sigma
and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega_Lambda >0 at the 3.0 sigma and
4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a
``minimal'' mass density, Omega_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection,
Omega_Lambda>0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior
(Omega_M+Omega_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require
Omega_Lambda >0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A
Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega_M=1) is ruled out at the 7
sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including
evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational
lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles
the data with Omega_Lambda=0 and q_0 > 0.},

This is an independent set of high-redshift SNe that confirms previous SN evidence for an accelerating universe. The high-quality light curves available from photometry on WFPC2 make it possible for these 11 SNe alone to provide measurements of the cosmological parameters comparable in statistical weight to the previous results. Combined with earlier Supernova Cosmology Project data, the new SNe yield a measurement of the mass density ΩM = 0.25 -0.06 +0.07 (statistical) ± 0.04 (identified systematics), or equivalently, a cosmological constant of ± = 0.75 -0.07 +0.06 (statistical) ± 0.04 (identified systematics), under the assumptions of a flat universe and that the dark energy equation-of-state parameter has a constant value w = -1. When the SN results are combined with independent flat-universe measurements of ΩM from cosmic microwave background and galaxy redshift distortion data, they provide a measurement of w = -1.05-0.20 +0.15 (statistical) ± 0.09 (identified systematic), if w is assumed to be constant in time. In addition to high-precision light-curve measurements, the new data offer greatly improved color measurements of the high-redshift SNe and hence improved host galaxy extinction estimates. These extinction measurements show no anomalous negative E(B-V) at high redshift. The precision of the measurements is such that it is possible to perform a host galaxy extinction correction directly for individual SNe without any assumptions or priors on the parent E(B-V) distribution. Our cosmological fits using full extinction corrections confirm that dark energy is required with P(ΩΛ > 0) > 0.99, a result consistent with previous and current SN analyses that rely on the identification of a low-extinction subset or prior assumptions concerning the intrinsic extinction distribution.},

flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0
cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the
cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda >
0) = 99%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age
of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t_0 = 14.9\{+1.4,-1.1\} (0.63/h)

of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We
find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or
Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our
high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a
width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

We first show and perform the various steps leading to a form of the equations suitable for the observational tests to be carried out.

The two events are named GW200105 162426 and GW200115 042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses 8.9 +1.2 −1.5 M and 1.9 +0.3 −0.2 M , whereas the source of GW200115 has component masses 5.7 +1.8 −2.1 M and 1.5 +0.7 −0.3 M (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of a neutron star is 89%-96% and 87%-98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115, with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source luminosity distances are 280 +110 −110 Mpc and 300 +150 −100 Mpc, respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23 at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115, the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain the spin or tidal deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer an NSBH merger rate density of 45 +75 −33 Gpc −3 yr −1 when assuming that GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or 130 +112 −69 Gpc −3 yr −1 under the assumption of a broader distribution of component masses.},

The ability to reliably reconstruct the source position is important for multimessenger astronomy, as recently demonstrated with GW170817. We show that for detector networks comparable to the early operation of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, typical localization volumes are $\sim10^4$--$10^5~\mathrm\{Mpc^3\}$ corresponding to $\sim10^2$--$10^3$ potential host galaxies. The localization volume is a strong function of the network signal-to-noise ratio, scaling roughly $\propto \varrho_\{net\}^\{-6\}$. Fractional localizations improve with the addition of further detectors to the network. Our Dirichlet Process Gaussian-mixture model can be adopted for localizing events detected during future gravitational-wave observing runs, and used to facilitate prompt multimessenger follow-up.},

   abstract = {The generalized Chaplygin gas is usually defined as a barotropic perfect fluid with an equation of state p = −Aρ −α , where ρ and p are the proper energy density and pressure, respectively, and A and α are positive real parameters. It has been extensively studied in the literature as a quartessence prototype unifying dark matter and dark energy. Here, we consider an extended family of generalized Chaplygin gas models parameterized by three positive real parameters A, α and β, which, for two specific choices of β [β = 1 and β = (1 + α) /(2α)], is described by two different Lagrangians previously identified in the literature with the generalized Chaplygin gas. We show that, for β > 1/2, the linear stability conditions and the maximum value of the sound speed cs are regulated solely by β, with 0 ≤ cs ≤ 1 if β ≥ 1. We further demonstrate that in the non-relativistic regime the standard equation of state p = −Aρ −α of the generalized Chaplygin gas is always recovered, while in the relativistic regime this is true only if β = (1 + α) /(2α). We present a regularization of the (α → 0, A → ∞) limit of the generalized Chaplygin gas, showing that it leads to a logarithmic Chaplygin gas model with an equation of state of the form p = A ln (ρ/ρ *), where A is a real parameter and ρ * > 0 is an arbitrary energy density. We finally derive its Lagrangian formulation.},

The analysis presented here takes this fact into consideration to open one more perspective of verification of the generalized Chapligin gas model applicability. Nine particular cases are compared: one where no dark energy is present; two that simulate the Λ-CDM model; two where the gas acts like the traditional Chaplygin gas; and four where the dark energy is the generalized Chaplygin gas. The different spectra permit to distinguish the Λ-CDM and the Chaplygin gas scenarios.},

   abstract = {Much of the information we hope to extract from the gravitational-waves signatures of compact binaries is only obtainable when we can accurately constrain the inclination of the source. In this paper, we discuss in detail a degeneracy between the measurement of the binary distance and inclination which limits our ability to accurately measure the inclination using gravitational waves alone. This degeneracy is exacerbated by the expected distribution of events in the universe, which leads us to prefer face-on systems at a greater distance. We use a simplified model that only considers the binary distance and orientation, and show that this gives comparable results to the full parameter estimates obtained from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. For the advanced LIGO-Virgo network, it is only signals which are close to edge-on, with an inclination greater than $\sim 75^\{\circ\}$ that will be distinguishable from face-on systems. For extended networks which have good sensitivity to both gravitational wave polarizations, for face-on systems we will only be able to constrain the inclination of a signal with SNR 20 to be $45^\{\circ\}$ or less, and even for loud signals, with SNR of 100, the inclination of a face-on signal will only be constrained to $30^\{\circ\}$. For black hole mergers observed at cosmological distances, in the absence of higher modes or orbital precession, the strong degeneracy between inclination and distance dominates the uncertainty in measurement of redshift and hence the masses of the black holes.},

The novel and independent measurement is of particular interest given the existing tension between the value of the Hubble constant determined using Type Ia supernovae via the local distance ladder (73.24 ± 1.74) and that from Cosmic Microwave Background observations (66.93 ± 0.62) by ∼ 3 sigma 5, 6.

   abstract = {Simultaneous measurements of distance and redshift can be used to constrain the expansion history of the universe and associated cosmological parameters. Merging binary black hole (BBH) systems are standard sirens-their gravitational waveform provides direct information about the luminosity distance to the source. There is, however, a perfect degeneracy between the source masses and redshift; some nongravitational information is necessary to break the degeneracy and determine the redshift of the source. Here we suggest that the pair instability supernova (PISN) process, thought to be the source of the observed upper limit on the black hole mass in merging BBH systems at ~ M 45  , imprints a mass scale in the population of BBH mergers and permits a measurement of the redshift-luminosity-distance relation with these sources. We simulate five years of BBH detections in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors with a realistic BBH merger rate, mass distribution with smooth PISN cutoff, and measurement uncertainty. We show that after one year of operation at design sensitivity the BBH population can constrain H(z) to 6.1% at a pivot redshift z 0.8 . After five years the constraint improves to 2.9%. If the PISN cutoff is sharp, the uncertainty is smaller by about a factor of two. This measurement relies only on general relativity and the presence of a mass scale that is approximately fixed or calibrated across cosmic time; it is independent of any distance ladder. Observations by future "third-generation" gravitational wave detectors, which can see BBH mergers throughout the universe, would permit subpercent cosmographical measurements to z4 within one month of observation.

   abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant H 0 using the gravitational wave (GW) event GW190814, which resulted from the coalescence of a 23 M black hole with a 2.6 M compact object, as a standard siren. No compelling electromagnetic counterpart with associated host galaxy has been identified for this event, thus our analysis accounts for thousands of potential host galaxies within a statistical framework. The redshift information is obtained from the photometric redshift (photo-z) catalog from the Dark Energy Survey. The luminosity distance is provided by the gravitational wave sky map published by the LIGO/Virgo Collaboration. Since this GW event has the second-smallest sky localization area after GW170817, GW190814 is likely to provide the best constraint on cosmology from a single standard siren without identifying an electromagnetic counterpart. Our analysis uses photo-z probability distribution functions and corrects for photo-z biases. We also reanalyze the binary-black hole GW170814 within this updated framework. We explore how our findings impact the H 0 constraints from GW170817, the only GW merger associated with a unique host galaxy, and therefore the most powerful standard siren to date. From a combination of GW190814, GW170814 and GW170817, our analysis yields H 0 = 72.0 +12 −8.2 km s −1 Mpc −1 (68% Highest Density Interval, HDI) for a prior in H 0 uniform between [20, 140] km s −1 Mpc −1. The addition of GW190814 and GW170814 to GW170817 improves the 68% HDI from GW170817 alone by ∼ 18%, showing how well-localized mergers without counterparts can provide a significant contribution to standard siren measurements, provided that a complete galaxy catalog is available at the location of the event.},

Repeating the calculation for GW190814, we obtain H 0 = 67 +41.0 −26.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 and H 0 = 71 +34.0 −30.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 for L B ≥ 0.001 L * B and L B ≥ 0.626 L * B , respectively. Combining the posteriors for both events yields H 0 = 70 +29.0 −18.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 , demonstrating the improvement on constraints when using multiple gravitational-wave events. We also confirm the results of other works that adopt this method, showing that increasing the L B threshold enhances the posterior structure and slightly shifts the distribution's peak to higher H 0 values.We repeat the joint inference using the low-spin PhenomPNRT (Abbott et al. 2019a) and the newly available combined (SEOBNRv4PHM + IMRPhenomPv3HM; Abbott et al. 2020) posterior samples for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively, achieving a tighter constraint of H 0 = 69 +29.0 −14.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 .},

   abstract = {We study the gravitational wave (GW) signal from eight new 3D core-collapse supernova simulations. We show that the signal is dominated by f-and g-mode oscillations of the protoneutron star (PNS) and its frequency evolution encodes the contraction rate of the latter, which, in turn, is known to depend on the star's mass, on the equation of state, and on transport properties in warm nuclear matter. A lower-frequency component of the signal, associated with the standing accretion shock instability, is found in only one of our models. Finally, we show that the energy radiated in GWs is proportional to the amount of turbulent energy accreted by the PNS.},

   abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are second-generation instruments designed and built for the two LIGO observatories in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA, USA. The two instruments are identical in design, and are specialized versions of a Michelson interferometer with 4 km long arms. As in Initial LIGO, Fabry-Perot cavities are used in the arms to increase the interaction time with a gravitational wave, and power recycling is used to increase the effective laser power. Signal recycling has been added in Advanced LIGO to improve the frequency response. In the most sensitive frequency region around 100 Hz, the design strain sensitivity is a factor of 10 better than Initial LIGO. In addition, the low frequency end of the sensitivity band is moved from 40 Hz down to 10 Hz. All interferometer components have been replaced with improved technologies to achieve this sensitivity gain. Much better seismic isolation and test mass suspensions are responsible for the gains at lower frequencies. Higher laser power, larger test masses and improved mirror coatings lead to the improved sensitivity at mid and high frequencies. Data collecting runs with these new instruments are planned to begin in mid-2015.},

   abstract = {Previous versions of the LIGO and Virgo detectors had searched for gravitational waves, but were not sensitive enough to distinguish true signals from the background noise of the detectors. The sensitivity improvement that lead to the discovery was the result of many decades of design and experience with the earlier instruments. Following the detection announcement, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) has published a paper, titled "The Sensitivity of the Advanced LIGO Detectors at the Beginning of Gravitational Wave Astronomy," which describes a variety of noise sources and quantifies their impact on the detectors. The paper is intended to detail the physical processes which limited the sensitivity of the detectors during Advanced LIGO's first observation run, which was conducted between September 12, 2015 and January 12, 2016. During this period, LIGO scientists only made instrument modifications when necessary to fix malfunctioning equipment, and the detectors were maintained in a low-noise observing state as much as possible. The L-shaped LIGO instruments consist of two perpendicular arms, each two and one-half miles (4 kilometers) long. A passing gravitational wave will alternately stretch one arm and squeeze the other, and then vice-versa; this generates an interference pattern at the readout port of the interferometer, which is measured by photo-detectors. Many non-gravitational signals can move the mirrors or affect the laser light in a way that can mimic or mask a gravitational wave signal. These noises are generated by many different physical phenomena, and the sum of all the noises leads to the familiar sensitivity curves of the detectors as a function of frequency (see Fig. 2 at right). The detectors have been designed so that these noises are extremely quiet, but gravitational wave signals are equally small, and even the most imperceptible forces on the mirrors are enough to spoil the measurement. THE SIGNAL AND THE NOISE On September 14, 2015, the two detectors Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observed a gravitational wave signal generated by the merger of two black holes. The LIGO detectors were recently upgraded with new instrumentation and now operate as Advanced LIGO, able to measure changes in the local shape of space-time with a precision better than one-thousandth the diameter of a proton. Gravitational waves are traveling perturbations in the shape of space-time, generated by cataclysmic events in distant galaxies. The detection of gravitational waves has been a long-held goal of the physics community, and represents a futher confirmation of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. Figure 1. The Advanced LIGO detectors are Michelson interferometers with 4-km long arms. The arms contain Fabry-Perot optical cavities to amplify the signal from a gravitational wave. The electromagnetic field from the laser is modulated at radio frequencies (9 and 45 MHz) to generate signals used to control the detector, and the spatial profile of the beam is cleanedf using an optical cavity (the Input Mode Cleaner). A mirror placed between the input mode cleaner and the beamsplitter (the Power Recycling Mirror) is used to recycle the laser power that is rereflected by the arms, and another mirror (the Signal Recycling Mirror) between the beamsplitter and the readout photodetectors is used to alter the frequency response of the interferometer. The Output Mode Cleaner removes excess laser light before the signal is measured by photodetectors.},

   abstract = {The current LIGO calibration technique's application is limited to the primary frequency band from DC to 8 kHz. It assumes a constant antenna pattern and approximates the detector's length response, resulting in a systematic, frequency dependent error. The recent addition of two high-frequency bands centered on the cavity free spectral range frequency of 37.52 kHz and its first integer multiple 75.04kHz requires that the calibration be modified. The effect of the gravitational-wave frequency on the antenna pattern is discussed and quantified. The frequency dependence of the detectors length response is analyzed with emphasis on the gravitational-wave frequencies corresponding to multiples of the cavity free spectral range. A modified calibration procedure is proposed that eliminates the systematic error in addition to allowing calibration in the high-frequency band.},

   abstract = {Detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from merging binary black holes (BHs) by Advanced LIGO has ushered in the new era of GW astronomy. Many conceivable sources such as intermediate-mass BH binaries and white dwarf binaries, as well as stellar-mass BH inspirals, would emit GWs below 10 Hz. It is highly desirable to open a new window for GW astronomy in the infrasound frequency band. A low-frequency tensor detector could be constructed by combining six magnetically levitated superconducting test masses. Such a detector would be equally sensitive to GWs coming from anywhere in the sky, and would be capable of resolving the source direction and wave polarization. I will present the design concept of a new terrestrial GW detector, named SOGRO, which could reach a strain sensitivity of 10-19-10-21 Hz-1/2 at 0.1-10 Hz. Seismic and Newtonian gravity noises are serious obstacles in constructing terrestrial GW detectors at frequencies below 10 Hz. I will explain how these noises are rejected in SOGRO. I will also report the progress made in designing the platform and modelling its thermal noise.},

If GW190521 is from a quasicircular binary inspiral, then the detected signal is consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses of 85-14+21 Mm and 66-18+17 Mm (90% credible intervals). We infer that the primary black hole mass lies within the gap produced by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova processes, with only a 0.32% probability of being below 65 Mm. We calculate the mass of the remnant to be 142-16+28 Mm, which can be considered an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The luminosity distance of the source is 5.3-2.6+2.4 Gpc, corresponding to a redshift of 0.82-0.34+0.28. The inferred rate of mergers similar to GW190521 is 0.13-0.11+0.30 Gpc-3 yr-1.},

   abstract = {The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere, in showing that the signal was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The black holes were each of approximately 35 Mʘ, still orbited each other as close as ∼350 km apart and subsequently merged to form a single black hole. Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in gravitational waves.},

   abstract = {This tutorial leads the reader through the details of calculating the properties of gravitational waves from orbiting binaries, such as two orbiting black holes. Using analogies with electromagnetic radiation, the tutorial presents a calculation that produces the same dependence on the masses of the orbiting objects, the orbital frequency, and the mass separation as does the linear version of General Relativity (GR). However, the calculation yields polarization, angular distributions, and overall power results that differ from those of GR. Nevertheless, the calculation produces waveforms that are nearly identical to the pre-binary-merger portions of the signals observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO-Virgo) collaboration. The tutorial should be easily understandable by students who have taken a standard upper-level undergraduate course in electromagnetism. a},

   abstract = {Searches are under way in Advanced LIGO and Virgo data for persistent gravitational waves from continuous sources, e.g. rapidly rotating galactic neutron stars, and stochastic sources, e.g. relic gravitational waves from the Big Bang or superposition of distant astrophysical events such as mergers of black holes or neutron stars. These searches can be degraded by the presence of narrow spectral artifacts (lines) due to instrumental or environmental disturbances. We describe a variety of methods used for finding, identifying and mitigating these artifacts, illustrated with particular examples. Results are provided in the form of lists of line artifacts that can safely be treated as non-astrophysical. Such lists are used to improve the efficiencies and sensitivities of continuous and stochastic gravitational wave searches by allowing vetoes of false outliers and permitting data cleaning.},

   abstract = {We describe some key astrophysical processes driving the formation and evolution of black hole binaries of different nature, from stellar-mass to supermassive systems. In the first part, we focus on the mainstream channels proposed for the formation of stellar mass binaries relevant to ground-based gravitational wave detectors, namely the \{\it field\} and the \{\it dynamical\} scenarios. For the field scenario, we highlight the relevant steps in the evolution of the binary, including mass transfer, supernovae explosions and kicks, common envelope and gravitational wave emission. For the dynamical scenario, we describe the main physical processes involved in the formation of star clusters and the segregation of black holes in their centres. We then identify the dynamical processes leading to binary formation, including three-body capture, exchanges and hardening. The second part of the notes is devoted to massive black hole formation and evolution, including the physics leading to mass accretion and binary formation. Throughout the notes, we provide several step-by-step pedagogical derivations, that should be particularly suited to undergraduates and PhD students, but also to gravitational wave physicists interested in approaching the subject of gravitational wave sources from an astrophysical perspective.},

   abstract = {The merger of a binary black hole gives birth to a highly distorted final black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted as this black hole relaxes presents us with the unique opportunity to probe extreme gravity and its connection with the dynamics of the black hole horizon. Using numerical relativity simulations, we demonstrate a connection between a concrete observable feature in the gravitational waves and geometrical features on the dynamical apparent horizon of the final black hole. Specifically, we show how the line-of-sight passage of a “cusp”-like defect on the horizon of the final black hole correlates with “chirp”-like frequency peaks in the post-merger gravitational-waves. These post-merger chirps should be observed and analyzed as the sensitivity of LIGO and Virgo increase and as future generation detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope, become operational.},

The recent addition of two high-frequency bands centered on the cavity free spectral range frequency of 37.52 kHz and its first integer multiple 75.04kHz requires that the calibration be modified. The effect of the gravitational-wave frequency on the antenna pattern is discussed and quantified. The frequency dependence of the detectors length response is analyzed with emphasis on the gravitational-wave frequencies corresponding to multiples of the cavity free spectral range. A modified calibration procedure is proposed that eliminates the systematic error in addition to allowing calibration in the high-frequency band.},
