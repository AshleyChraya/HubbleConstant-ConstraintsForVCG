We thank Dr. Geetanjali Sethi for accepting to be our supervisor
and for suggesting us this topic in which we have developed a deep interest for our internship. Our gratitude is not only limited to his scientific experience that guided us towards the research project, but also includes insightful and valuable discussions, we had during our internship duration. We also express our deepest gratitude to her for her patience, continuous support, and giving us the freedom to learn at our own pace. \\\\
Clearly, this project would not have been possible without the support of --------. \\\\

Lastly, I would like to thank SARSTEM for generously sponsoring the project \\\\
