In this report, the parameters of the Variable Chaplygin Gas model, $\Omega_{m}$ and $n$, were constrained by finding the best fit between the observed value of the luminosity distance and distance modulus of Supernova events and Gravitational Wave Events at different redshifts to the theoretical values predicted by the Variable Chaplygin Gas model.
