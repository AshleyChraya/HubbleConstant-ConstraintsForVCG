This repository contains Python codes for constraining parameters of VCG model by Chi-square minimization method and MCMC (Metropolis Hastings algorithm) using Supernoav data and GW data, and constraining Hubble Constant by least square method, orthogonal regression method and MCMC method using both SN and GW merger data (including newly released O3b dataset).
